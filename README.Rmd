## Introduction
  
ADHD is a neuro biological disorder characterized by attention deficit and hyperactivity/impulsiveness (Purper-Ouakil *et al.*, 2011). People can have this disorder with or without the hyperactivity. Indeed, the symptoms are displayed on a spectrum (Heidbreder, 2015). Thus, the diagnosis is not always easy to establish. ADHD is mostly present in children but can persist into adulthood in 15 to 65% of cases (Katzman *et al.*, 2017). Moreover, like for many deceases and disorders, the research focused on white men for a long time. Therefore there still are some miss or delayed diagnosis for some ethnical and social groups and for women in general too (Dvorsky & Langberg, 2016). The main cause of this gender bias diagnosis is the mentioned focus of the research on symptoms typically shown on men, hence the recurrent delay in diagnose of girls. 

First of all, hormonal fluctuation in females may change the display of the symptoms and thus they might not as salient as for men (Dvorsky & Langberg, 2016). Then, symptoms for male are more externalized like hyperactivity/impulsiveness (at least in childhood) whereas females tend to be more inattentive (Quinn & Wigal, 2004) and their hyperactivity is more internal with overt symptoms, such as displaying them in hypertalkativeness way or emotional re-activity (Quinn, 2005). Therefore, their symptoms are less noticeable than males ones (Katzman *et al.*, 2017). Moreover, with a late diagnosis, females also have more time to developed coping strategies making the diagnosis even more difficult to establish (Katzman *et al.*, 2017). In addition, linked with hormonal fluctuations and commodities resulting from a delayed diagnosis,  such as chronic anxiety, mood disorder etc., females are often blurring medical examination and tend to be firstly diagnosed with depression or other mood disorder (Quinn, 2005). Finally, society has also a role in this bias, indeed, girls are being told since childhood to internalized negative feedback, to accommodate, to be quiet and calm etc. Men, on the other hand, are being encouraged to be open, dynamic and to take opportunities etc.(Quinn, 2005). As a matter of fact, as I said before, girls will developed coping strategies and internalized their hyperactivity and increase the risk to develop anxiety, low self-esteem etc. (Quinn, 2005). 

Apart from the lack of research on women, it seems that boys have a 2 to 2.5 higher prevalence of ADHD than girls (Dvorsky & Langberg, 2016). However, I feel like those numbers are difficult to estimate because ADHD is becoming more and more well-known, we see an increasing number of diagnoses among the world and maybe with the research on females being on the rise too, the average of people with ADHD might be even higher than we think.

## Data analyses

Since girls are often miss- and mis- diagnosed, and when they are, the diagnosis is often delayed, my hypothesis is the following:

&rarr; **â€œThe difference between children and adult women with ADHD is lower than the difference between children and adult men with ADHD."**   

As previously mentioned, 15-65% of children will still have ADHD while growing up. If we take into account that some girls might have delayed diagnoses, often only at adulthood, the difference between the girls' and the women rate will be smaller. Regarding the boys' and the men rate, boys are more likely to be diagnosed as childs and thus the percentage of grown up men with ADHD will follow the trend of 15 to 65% of children diagnosed who will still have ADHD while growing up. 


### Data

First of all, I was interested in confirming whether boys with ADHD were more numerous than girls. I took my [data](https://www.childhealthdata.org/browse/survey/allstates?q=9343&g=1008&a=18062#) from the *National Survey of Children's Health* of the USA, from a 2020-2021 survey. The data identify children age ranging from 3 to 17 years old from each states of the USA with a current diagnosis of ADHD. 



**The table looks like this:** 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
children <- readxl::read_xlsx("children_gender.xlsx")
my_table <- (head(children))

my_table %>% kable()  
  
```   
  
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#For further information about my data

summary(children)

children %>% kable()

```

 **&rarr;** **Therefore I decided to do a boxplot to confirm the expected results:**

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE }


ggplot(children, aes(x= Gender, y= ADHD, fill=Gender))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  ggtitle("Percentage of children with ADHD in the USA")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5) )


girls <- children %>% filter(Gender=="F") %>% filter(ADHD=TRUE)


boys <- children %>% filter(Gender=="M") %>% filter(ADHD=TRUE)


mean_boys <- mean(boys$ADHD)


mean_girls <- mean(girls$ADHD)


children_tab <- data.frame("Girls" =mean_girls, "Boys" = mean_boys)

test_children <- t.test(girls$ADHD, boys$ADHD)


#results: t = -11.872, df = 83.933, p-value < 2.2e-16
#significant difference between boys and girls 


``` 


As we can see on the boxplot, and after realizing a t.test, the average of boys with ADHD is significantly higher than the average of girls (p-value < 0,05). 


Then, I took data about the mean percentage of adults in the USA with ADHD. [My data](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd#part_2553) come from the *National Institute of Mental Health*. Unfortunately, the most recent data I could find for the USA are from 2006. 


* **I decided to build a barplot in order to compare the mean for men and for women adults:** 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gridExtra)

adult <- readxl::read_xlsx("adult_adhd.xlsx")

mean_adult <- data.frame("Women"= 3.2, "Men"= 5.4)


ggplot(adult, aes(x= Gender, y= Percentage, fill=Gender))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5)+
  ggtitle("Average of adult with ADHD in the USA")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))+
  ylim(0,15)

plot1 <- ggplot(adult, aes(x= Gender, y= Percentage, fill=Gender))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5)+
  ylim(0,15)+
  theme(legend.position ="none")+
  xlab("Adults")

mean_adult %>% kable(caption="Percentage of adult with ADHD in the USA")

test_adult <- t.test(mean_adult)


#results: t = 3.9091, df = 1, p-value = 0.1594
#seems to be no significant difference between men and women --> so something must have changed between adult and children. seems to go in the direction of my hypothesis. 
  
``` 

This time, the t.test I realized showed no significant difference between the men and the women percentage with ADHD. This change of significance may go in the direction of my hypothesis ( p-value = 0.1594).   


```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
children_mean <- readxl::read_xlsx("children_mean.xlsx")
female_tab <- readxl::read_xlsx("female_tab.xlsx")
male_tab <- readxl::read_xlsx("male_tab.xlsx")



ggplot(children_mean, aes(x=Gender, y=Percentage, fill=Gender))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5)+
  ggtitle("Average of children with ADHD in the USA")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))+
  ylim(0,15)

children_tab %>% kable(caption = " Average percentage of children with ADHD in the USA")


plot2 <- ggplot(children_mean, aes(x=Gender, y=Percentage, fill=Gender))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5)+
  ylim(0,15)+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  xlab("Children")

```  

* **In order to have a better visualization of mean percentage for children with ADHD compared to adults with ADHD, I decided to group the barplots.** 


```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

grid.arrange(plot1,plot2, ncol=2, top="Average population with ADHD in the USA")


female_plot <- ggplot(female_tab, aes(x=Gender, y=Percentage))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5, fill="coral1")+
  ylim(0,15)+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  xlab("Female")
  

male_plot <- ggplot(male_tab, aes(x=Gender, y=Percentage))+
   geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5, fill="darkturquoise")+
  ylim(0,15)+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  xlab("Male")

grid.arrange(female_plot,male_plot, ncol=2, top="Difference between children and adults")



both <- matrix(c(3.2,5.4,6.55,13.13), ncol=4, byrow=TRUE)

colnames(both)= c("Female","Male","Girls","Boys")

both %>% kable(caption="Average population with ADHD")




percent <- matrix(c("~ 49%", "~ 43%"), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
colnames(percent)= c("Women","Men")

percent %>% kable(caption="Percentage of adults who still have ADHD")  

```   

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
results <- t.test(male_tab$Percentage,female_tab$Percentage, var.equal = FALSE)
results

#results: t = 1.0422, df = 1.3628, p-value = 0.4473
#as the significance value alpha = 0.05, p-value is > and so there is no significance difference between F and M, ADHD.   

```    





As I said previously, it is estimated that 15 to 65 % of children will still have ADHD while growing up.  
On the last table, we can see that we still have an average of 49% of 6.55 % of girls who still have ADHD while growing up. For the men we have a bit less than this average, since around 43% of the 13.13% of boys with ADHD will still have the disorder as an adult. I also realized a t.test which showed no significance for this difference of percentage between male and female (p-value = 0.4473). Both 43% and 49% are in the expected results of children who would keep the disorder in adulthood. 

***

## Results

* **If we recap:**   


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
test_table <- matrix(c("p-value < 2.2e-16", "p-value = 0.1594","p-value = 0.4473"), ncol=3, byrow = TRUE)
colnames(test_table)= c("For children", "For adults", "For children vs adults")

test_table %>%kable(caption="T.test for significance")


``` 

There is only one significant difference for the percentage of boys and girls diagnosed with ADHD. The fact that there isn't significant difference among adult might go on the same direction as my hypothesis. Moreover, the higher percentage of girls who might keep ADHD while growing up comparing to the one for boys slightly supports my hypothesis. However, my hypothesis is not supported in a very reliable way as there is no significant difference between these two percentages. 

Furthermore, I couldn't find data for both adults and children from the same year of survey and the research about ADHD are increasing such as awareness. Therefore, my results aren't very reliable since I might not be comparing the same proportion of percentage in the actual population. 


***


## Conclusion

As I said previously, my results aren't very reliable. However, it seems that girls still have a higher rate of delayed diagnosis which can be very impactful in their life. Actually, an early diagnosis in childhood allows for the development of a treatment plan and strategies to deal with everything that ADHD entails (for example organization problem, focus, school tasks etc.). As a matter of facts, an undiagnosed and not treated ADHD increase the risk of developing comorbidities such as anxiety, psychological distress, depression and low self-esteem (Quinn, 2005). It also often leads to social relationship impairs, school/working failure, general demoralization and increase the risk of consuming drugs or alcohol (Quinn, 2005). This not only impacts women but also threatens public health. Indeed, untreated/undiagnosed women tend to be less able to be consistent parents and less able to manage their job and private life. In addition, the anxiety and stress resulting from all these struggles can cause several important deceases (Quinn, 2005). 

For all the reasons I have mentioned in this paper, awareness about ADHD is very important in order to increase the number of diagnoses and not to forget anyone that could suffer in silence. Finally, as Dvorksy and Langberg (2016) suggest, "it may be preferable to ensure that (a) diagnostic items reflect both male- and female-specific manifestations, (b) subtle indicators of inattention/disorganization are probed, and (c) clinicians inquire about such factors as compensatory behaviors and life transitions in girls and women."
