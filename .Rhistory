## Introduction
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
ADHD is a neuro biological disorder characterized by attention deficit and hyperactivity/impulsiveness (Purper-Ouakil *et al.*, 2011). People can have this disorder with or without the hyperactivity. Indeed, the symptoms are displayed on a spectrum (Heidbreder, 2015). Thus, the diagnosis is not always easy to establish. ADHD is mostly present in children but can persist into adulthood in 15 to 65% of cases (Katzman *et al.*, 2017). Moreover, like for many deceases and disorders, the research focused on white men for a long time. Therefore therefore there still have some miss or delayed diagnosis for some ethnical and social groups and for women in general too (Dvorsky & Langberg, 2016). Regarding the gender bias for ADHD diagnosis, as I said, the diagnoses were based on men symptoms and there are several reasons that girls diagnoses are often delayed.
library("stringr")
First of all, hormonal fluctuation in female may change the display of the symptoms and thus they might not as salient as for men (Dvorsky & Langberg, 2016). Then, symptoms for male are more externalized like hyperactivity/impulsiveness (at least in childhood) whereas female tend to be more inattentive (Quinn & Wigal, 2004) and their hyperactivity is more internal with overt symptoms, such as displaying them in hypertalkativeness way or emotional re-activity (Quinn, 2005). Therefore, female symptoms are less noticeable than male ones (Katzman *et al.*, 2017). Moreover, with a late diagnosis, female have also more time to developed coping strategies that make the diagnosis even more difficult to establish (Katzman *et al.*, 2017). In addition, linked with hormones fluctuations and commodities resulting from a delayed diagnosis,  such as chronic anxiety, mood disorder etc., female are often blurring medical examination and tend to be firstly diagnosed with depression or other mood disorder (Quinn, 2005). Finally, society has also a role in this bias. Indeed, girls are being told since childhood to internalized negative feedback, to accommodate, to be quiet and calm etc. whereas men boys are externalized and to be dynamic and to take opportunities etc.(Quinn, 2005). As a matter of fact, as I said before, girls will developed coping strategies and internalized their hyperactivity and increase the risk to develop anxiety, low self-esteem etc. (Quinn, 2005).
Apart from the lack of research on women, it seems that boys have from 2 to 2.5 higher prevalence of ADHD than girls (Dvorsky & Langberg, 2016). However, I feel like those numbers are difficult to estimate because ADHD is becoming more and more known, we see an increasing number of diagnoses among the world and maybe with the increase of research on females too, the average of people with ADHD migh be even higher than we think.
## Data analyses
Since girls are often miss- and mis- diagnosed, and when they are, the diagnosis is often delayed, my hypothesis is the following:
&rarr; **“The difference of children and adult women with ADHD is lower than the difference of children and adult men with ADHD."**
Indeed, as I said previously, 15-65% of children will still have ADHD while growing up. If we take into account that some girls might have delayed diagnosis, like only at adulthood, the difference between the girls’ rate and the women's rate will be smaller. Regarding the boys’ rate and the men’s rate, boys are more likely to be diagnosed while children and thus the percentage of grown up men with ADHD will follow the trend of 15 to 65% of children diagnosed who will still have ADHD while growing up.
### Data
First of all, I was interested in confirming whether boys with ADHD were more numerous than girls. I took my [data](https://www.childhealthdata.org/browse/survey/allstates?q=9343&g=1008&a=18062#) from the *National Survey of Children's Health* of the USA, from a 2020-2021 survey. The data identify children from 3 to 17 years old from each states of the USA with a current diagnosis of ADHD.
**The table looks like this:**
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
**&rarr;** **Therefore I decided to do a boxplot to confirm the expected results:**
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE }
children_tab <- data.frame("Girls" =mean_girls, "Boys" = mean_boys)

Then, symptoms for male are more externalized like hyperactivity/impulsiveness (at least in childhood) whereas female tend to be more inattentive (Quinn & Wigal, 2004) and their hyperactivity is more internal with overt symptoms, such as displaying them in hypertalkativeness way or emotional re-activity (Quinn, 2005). Therefore, female symptoms are less noticeable than male ones (Katzman *et al.*, 2017). Moreover, with a late diagnosis, female have also more time to developed coping strategies that make the diagnosis even more difficult to establish (Katzman *et al.*, 2017). In addition, linked with hormones fluctuations and commodities resulting from a delayed diagnosis,  such as chronic anxiety, mood disorder etc., female are often blurring medical examination and tend to be firstly diagnosed with depression or other mood disorder (Quinn, 2005). Finally, society has also a role in this bias. Indeed, girls are being told since childhood to internalized negative feedback, to accommodate, to be quiet and calm etc. whereas men boys are externalized and to be dynamic and to take opportunities etc.(Quinn, 2005). As a matter of fact, as I said before, girls will developed coping strategies and internalized their hyperactivity and increase the risk to develop anxiety, low self-esteem etc. (Quinn, 2005).
Apart from the lack of research on women, it seems that boys have from 2 to 2.5 higher prevalence of ADHD than girls (Dvorsky & Langberg, 2016). However, I feel like those numbers are difficult to estimate because ADHD is becoming more and more known, we see an increasing number of diagnoses among the world and maybe with the increase of research on females too, the average of people with ADHD migh be even higher than we think.
## Data analyses
Since girls are often miss- and mis- diagnosed, and when they are, the diagnosis is often delayed, my hypothesis is the following:
&rarr; **“The difference of children and adult women with ADHD is lower than the difference of children and adult men with ADHD."**
Indeed, as I said previously, 15-65% of children will still have ADHD while growing up. If we take into account that some girls might have delayed diagnosis, like only at adulthood, the difference between the girls’ rate and the women's rate will be smaller. Regarding the boys’ rate and the men’s rate, boys are more likely to be diagnosed while children and thus the percentage of grown up men with ADHD will follow the trend of 15 to 65% of children diagnosed who will still have ADHD while growing up.
### Data
First of all, I was interested in confirming whether boys with ADHD were more numerous than girls. I took my [data](https://www.childhealthdata.org/browse/survey/allstates?q=9343&g=1008&a=18062#) from the *National Survey of Children's Health* of the USA, from a 2020-2021 survey. The data identify children from 3 to 17 years old from each states of the USA with a current diagnosis of ADHD.
**The table looks like this:**
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
my_table <- (head(children))
**&rarr;** **Therefore I decided to do a boxplot to confirm the expected results:**
summary(children)
str(children)
summary(children)
str(children)
str(children[3])
str(children[4])
children <- readxl::read_xlsx("children_gender.xlsx")
my_table <- (head(children))

## Introduction
ADHD is a neuro biological disorder characterized by attention deficit and hyperactivity/impulsiveness (Purper-Ouakil *et al.*, 2011). People can have this disorder with or without the hyperactivity. Indeed, the symptoms are displayed on a spectrum (Heidbreder, 2015). Thus, the diagnosis is not always easy to establish. ADHD is mostly present in children but can persist into adulthood in 15 to 65% of cases (Katzman *et al.*, 2017). Moreover, like for many deceases and disorders, the research focused on white men for a long time. Therefore there still are some miss or delayed diagnosis for some ethnical and social groups and for women in general too (Dvorsky & Langberg, 2016). The main cause of this gender bias diagnosis is the mentioned focus of the research on symptoms typically shown on men, hence the recurrent delay in diagnose of girls.
First of all, hormonal fluctuation in females may change the display of the symptoms and thus they might not as salient as for men (Dvorsky & Langberg, 2016). Then, symptoms for male are more externalized like hyperactivity/impulsiveness (at least in childhood) whereas females tend to be more inattentive (Quinn & Wigal, 2004) and their hyperactivity is more internal with overt symptoms, such as displaying them in hypertalkativeness way or emotional re-activity (Quinn, 2005). Therefore, their symptoms are less noticeable than males ones (Katzman *et al.*, 2017). Moreover, with a late diagnosis, females also have more time to developed coping strategies making the diagnosis even more difficult to establish (Katzman *et al.*, 2017). In addition, linked with hormonal fluctuations and commodities resulting from a delayed diagnosis,  such as chronic anxiety, mood disorder etc., females are often blurring medical examination and tend to be firstly diagnosed with depression or other mood disorder (Quinn, 2005). Finally, society has also a role in this bias, indeed, girls are being told since childhood to internalized negative feedback, to accommodate, to be quiet and calm etc. Men, on the other hand, are being encouraged to be open, dynamic and to take opportunities etc.(Quinn, 2005). As a matter of fact, as I said before, girls will developed coping strategies and internalized their hyperactivity and increase the risk to develop anxiety, low self-esteem etc. (Quinn, 2005).
Apart from the lack of research on women, it seems that boys have a 2 to 2.5 higher prevalence of ADHD than girls (Dvorsky & Langberg, 2016). However, I feel like those numbers are difficult to estimate because ADHD is becoming more and more well-known, we see an increasing number of diagnoses among the world and maybe with the research on females being on the rise too, the average of people with ADHD might be even higher than we think.
